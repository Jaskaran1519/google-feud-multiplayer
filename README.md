Hey, this game ia a multiplayer version of the famous internet game google feud 
you can invite your friends and play together
Use the chat and compete with all the players in the room to get the crown
The project is fully complete ( on 7th dec 2024 ), I will be adding the main game logic in few days and some more features like voice chat and discord like soundboard too
Thanks
